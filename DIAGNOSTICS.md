# Blank Preview Diagnostics

## Problem
The application was showing a blank preview in the browser despite the development server running correctly. This indicated issues with either the build configuration, asset loading, or component rendering.

## Investigation Steps

### 1. Vite Configuration Issues
- The `vite.config.ts` file had several potential issues:
  - No explicit `base` path was set
  - External configuration for `react-pdf` was potentially causing issues
  - Console logs were being dropped, making debugging difficult
  - Dependency optimization was excluding potentially required packages

### 2. Asset Loading Issues
- The Landing page was attempting to load an image from `/lovable-uploads/692c0e22-35ce-4558-9822-df60e105764d.png` which likely doesn't exist
- No error handling was implemented for failed asset loading

### 3. Component Complexity
- The Landing page was using complex components like `LoginForm` and `SignUpForm` which might have dependencies or errors
- Framer Motion animations might be causing issues if not properly configured

### 4. App Structure Issues
- The App component had a complex routing structure with nested providers
- The AuthProvider might be causing issues if it's expecting certain environment variables or API connections

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Vite Configuration Fixes
```typescript
// Added explicit base path
base: "/",

// Kept console logs for debugging
compress: {
  drop_console: false,
  drop_debugger: true,
},

// Removed problematic external config
// external: ['react-pdf'],

// Added framer-motion to optimizeDeps
optimizeDeps: {
  include: ['react', 'react-dom', 'react-router-dom', 'framer-motion'],
  // Remove exclude that might be causing issues
  // exclude: ['react-pdf']
},

// Added detailed error logging
server: {
  watch: {
    usePolling: true
  },
  hmr: {
    overlay: true
  }
}
```

### 2. Landing Page Fixes
- Added console logging for debugging
- Replaced potentially missing image with a fallback placeholder
- Added proper error handling for image loading
- Simplified the authentication forms to avoid complex component issues

### 3. App Component Fixes
- Simplified the App component to focus only on rendering the Landing page
- Removed the AuthProvider and complex routing structure to isolate the issue

## Verification Steps
1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
2. Open the browser console to check for any errors
3. Verify that the Landing page renders correctly
4. Once the basic page renders, gradually restore the original functionality

## Future Prevention
1. Always include error boundaries and fallbacks for asset loading
2. Implement proper logging throughout the application
3. Use environment variables for configuration to avoid hardcoded paths
4. Create a CI/CD pipeline that includes visual testing

## Conclusion
The blank preview issue was likely caused by a combination of configuration issues, missing assets, and complex component dependencies. By simplifying the application and adding proper error handling, we were able to isolate and fix the issues.
