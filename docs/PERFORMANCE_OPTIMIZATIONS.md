# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the Agent Agreement Nexus application to improve load times, responsiveness, and overall user experience.

## Code Splitting

We've implemented code splitting using React.lazy() and Suspense to reduce the initial bundle size and improve load times:

- Each route is now loaded dynamically when needed
- Heavy components are lazy-loaded
- A fallback UI is shown during loading
- Error boundaries capture and report loading errors

Implementation details can be found in `src/routes.tsx`.

## Service Worker & Caching

We've implemented a service worker using Workbox to enable offline capabilities and improve performance:

### Caching Strategies

- **Static Assets**: CacheFirst strategy for styles, scripts, fonts, and images
- **API Responses**: StaleWhileRevalidate strategy for API calls
- **HTML Shell**: NetworkFirst strategy for the application shell

### Update Notifications

- Users are notified when a new version of the application is available
- A toast notification with an "Update now" button allows users to apply updates immediately

### Implementation Files

- `src/service-worker.ts`: Service worker implementation
- `src/serviceWorkerRegistration.ts`: Registration utilities
- `src/components/ServiceWorkerUpdateNotification.tsx`: Update notification component
- `public/offline.html`: Offline fallback page

## Performance Monitoring

We've implemented performance monitoring to track key metrics and identify bottlenecks:

### Web Vitals Tracking

- Core Web Vitals (CLS, FID, LCP, FCP, TTFB) are tracked and reported to Sentry
- Custom performance metrics for component rendering and API calls

### API Performance Monitoring

- API call durations are tracked and reported
- Slow API calls (>1s) are automatically reported to Sentry for investigation

### Implementation Files

- `src/utils/performanceMonitoring.ts`: Performance monitoring utilities

## Component Optimizations

We've optimized key components to reduce unnecessary renders and improve performance:

- `React.memo()` for pure components
- `useMemo()` for expensive calculations
- `useCallback()` for event handlers passed to child components
- Virtualized lists for long scrollable content

Examples can be found in:
- `src/components/admin/AgreementStatusChart.tsx`
- `src/components/admin/DashboardStats.tsx`

## Bundle Size Analysis

We've integrated rollup-plugin-visualizer to analyze bundle size and identify opportunities for optimization:

- Bundle analysis is generated during build in `dist/stats.html`
- Large dependencies are identified and optimized
- Tree-shaking is enabled to remove unused code

## Future Optimizations

Planned future optimizations include:

1. Implementing resource hints (preload, prefetch, preconnect)
2. Further optimizing image loading with responsive images and lazy loading
3. Implementing HTTP/2 server push for critical resources
4. Exploring server-side rendering (SSR) for improved initial load times
