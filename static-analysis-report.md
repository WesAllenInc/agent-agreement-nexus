# Static Code Analysis Report

## TypeScript Issues
- Multiple instances of `any` types that should be properly typed
- Type issues in hooks and components

## React Component Issues
- Multiple components with exports that break fast refresh
- Components that should be split into separate files

## Performance Issues
- Missing dependencies in useEffect hooks
- Large components that could be split into smaller ones

## Recommended Actions
1. Fix TypeScript `any` types with proper type definitions
2. Separate component logic and exports into dedicated files
3. Fix React hooks dependencies
4. Implement code splitting for large components
5. Add proper ESLint rules for React and TypeScript
